<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a pattern designer specializing in women's and children's clothing. I have 10 years of experience, 
  which I gained working in fabric and knitted fabric wholesalers and printing houses, where I designed patterns 
  for various clients and prepared patterns for digital and screen printing.
</p>

<p>I graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódź with a specialization in design. In order to deepen my knowledge,
   I also graduated from Postgraduate Studies in Graphics and Illustration. Currently, I create patterns like a designer 
   for individual orders. I specialize in watercolor and digital patterns. 
  Thanks to polishing my drawing, I can create various projects. The combination of traditional watercolor technique 
  and digital design gives my works a unique character.
</p>

<p>I draw inspiration from the beauty of the natural world, including floral motifs, animals in my designs. 
  I am also inspired by my 5-year-old daughter, who takes me into the world of a child. Each pattern is carefully refined. 
  To create a harmonious combination of color and form, I work in harmony with my own values and the world around me.
